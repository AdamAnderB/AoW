## Overview
This project offers a comprehensive guide for conducting eye-tracking studies in psycholinguistics through web-based methods. It focuses on making research accessible and reproducible, targeting bilingualism and multilingualism studies.

## Key Features
- **Framework for Reproducible Science**: Instructions for designing and analyzing eye-tracking studies.
- **Data Wrangling Guide**: Preparing eye-tracking data with R for analysis.
- **Best Practices**: Ensuring quality data collection and experimental design.
- **Open-Source Tools**: Emphasizing the use of R for data analysis.
- **Paper**: This is an earlier draft of the paper before the editing process when we were just getting started.

## Getting Started
1. **Installation**: Set up your environment with R and the necessary packages.
2. **Running Experiments**: Design your study and ensure data quality.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyze your data in R, from data wrangling to statistical modeling. Following along with our main script: AOW_r_work_flow.Rmd
