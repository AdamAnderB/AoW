\section{Conclusions}
Web-based eye-tracking is here to stay, and with that comes a demand for mastering data-wrangling skills. For the first time, researchers anywhere can design an experiment, implement their analysis, and share their results openly for the cost of participant payment. Additionally, the choices of how data is treated is now up to us, which leads to a need for widespread adoption of standardized practices beginning with experiment design and throughout all data analyses. As shown here and by \textcite{Prystauka_Altmann_Rothman_2023} and \textcite{Vos_2017}, web-based eye-tracking is a powerful and accessible tool. Its convenience, cost, and reliability make it an easy choice for any researcher while the data wrangling involved may be daunting. We hope that this barrier has now been lowered with our guide through the wilds of eye-tracking data wrangling in the \textit{\textbf{Art of Wrangling}}.
