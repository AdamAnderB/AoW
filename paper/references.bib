We first provide a brief overview of the reasons why R is popular among researchers in other fields and why we recommend its use for analyses in applied linguistics. In order to illustrate these benefits, we report recent works and developments in quantitative data analysis seeking to move the field toward more appropriate practices, many of which take advantage of the flexibility and functionality of R. Finally, in order to facilitate the use of R, we also introduce an R-based web application developed by the first author.},

  abstract = {Learn how to use R to turn raw data into insight, knowledge, and understanding. This book introduces you to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed to work together to make data science fast, fluent, and fun. Suitable for readers with no previous programming experience, R for Data Science is designed to get you doing data science as quickly as possible.

Authors Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund guide you through the steps of importing, wrangling, exploring, and modeling your data and communicating the results. You'll get a complete, big-picture understanding of the data science cycle, along with basic tools you need to manage the details. Each section of the book is paired with exercises to help you practice what you've learned along the way.

You'll learn how to:

    Wrangle—transform your datasets into a form convenient for analysis
    Program—learn powerful R tools for solving data problems with greater clarity and ease
    Explore—examine your data, generate hypotheses, and quickly test them
    Model—provide a low-dimensional summary that captures true "signals" in your dataset
    Communicate—learn R Markdown for integrating prose, code, and results},

                   estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models
                   can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4
                   package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the
                   model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this
                   case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The
                   formula and data together determine a numerical
                   representation of the model from which the profiled deviance
                   or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a
                   function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate
                   criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained
                   optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter
                   estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps
                   in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and
                   the structure of classes or types that represents such a
                   model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization
                   of these structures by users who wish to write functions to
                   fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models
                   incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not
                   easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.",
